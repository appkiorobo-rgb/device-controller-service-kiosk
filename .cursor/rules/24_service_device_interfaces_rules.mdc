# DEVICE INTERFACES RULES

## Interfaces
- ICamera, IPrinter, IPaymentTerminal are stable abstractions.
- Service Core depends ONLY on these interfaces.

## State-first
- Device results are expressed as states/events, not thrown exceptions.
- Implement explicit state machines (enum + data).

## No UI concepts
- No countdown, no screen flow, no pricing.
- Only hardware capabilities and device states.
