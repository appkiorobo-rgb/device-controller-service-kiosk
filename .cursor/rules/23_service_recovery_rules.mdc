# SERVICE RECOVERY RULES

## Recovery is mandatory
- reconnect + backoff for disconnects
- hung detection for no-response states
- bounded retries (no infinite tight loops)

## Hung detection
- Every operation has a timeout.
- If no progress/state change within timeout: enter hung recovery path.

## Restart strategy
- Restart is a normal recovery option.
- Expose a safe restart request command (admin trigger).
- Prefer fail-fast + restart over silent deadlocks.
