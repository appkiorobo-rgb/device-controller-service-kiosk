# OUTPUT FORMAT RULES (Mandatory)

When producing code or changes:

## Always
- Output COMPLETE files (not snippets) unless explicitly asked otherwise.
- Include file paths at the top of each file.
- Add concise comments for non-trivial logic.
- Include error handling and timeouts.

## For changes
- If editing existing files: show full updated file content.
- If adding new files: show full file content.
- List all files created/modified at the end.

## For architecture/logic tasks
- Provide:
  1) minimal plan (bullet list)
  2) clear assumptions
  3) boundaries (what belongs where)

## Testing
- If you add behavior, also add/describe how to test it (unit/widget/integration).
